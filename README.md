# nyxstrap 🌟
roblox launcher with modifiers[barely didnt have enough time] which is created for the NYX rbx script executor. more information on our discord about that.

# how it works ❔

simple. scans the app data, checks for "RobloxPlayerBeta.exe" in a dir named roblox. opens it and applies mods while the title exists. not rocket science at all anyone should be able to make this better because there are other methods such as using robloxs cdn download and putting them in a custom path.
