# nyxstrap 🌟
roblox launcher with modifiers[barely didnt have enough time] which is created for the NYX rbx script executor. more information on our discord about that.

# how it works ❔

simple. scans the app data, checks for "RobloxPlayerBeta.exe" in a dir named roblox. opens it and applies mods while the title exists. not rocket science at all anyone should be able to make this better because there are other methods such as using robloxs cdn download and putting them in a custom path.


# modifiers

- top most
- renaming window(disabled)

# soon 🤪

- discord rpc of game name, player name [easy, just make nyx writefile and read the log, display in rpc]
- fps count [getfpscap() function and writefile it each second]
- window mods [topmost, transparent]
- built in nyx overlay [just puts nyx inside of roblox, making the illusion of an internal interface]
- override roblox launcher [if roblox launcher shows, it will simply put ours on top]
- join games for you [roblox:// should do it]
